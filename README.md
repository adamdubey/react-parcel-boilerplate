# react-parcel-boilerplate

_The middle-ground between Create-React-App & Webpack_

---

## Usage

_localhost:_

```sh
$ yarn watch
# in browser, visit localhost:1234
```

A quick/fast boilerplate framework for building React.js applications!

Development workflows remain much the same, with the notable exception of _not_ having to manually install project dependencies via `npm i ` or `yarn add` - Parcel automatically detects and installs the necessary packages as they are imported into your project.
